/**
 * Single-flight access-token refresh.
 *
 * The refresh flow is the trickiest part of the auth pipeline because
 * it's racing on three axes at once:
 *   1. Many pending requests may all notice the access token is stale
 *      at the same time and try to refresh in parallel.
 *   2. The refresh request itself goes through the same axios client
 *      whose interceptors triggered it - we have to break that loop.
 *   3. The store is the source of truth for tokens, but reading from
 *      it after the refresh request returns races with persistence.
 *
 * The mitigations:
 *   - A module-level `inFlight` promise ensures all callers share one
 *     network round-trip (point 1).
 *   - The internal `_isRefresh` flag on the axios config tells the
 *     interceptors to skip the auth pipeline (point 2).
 *   - The new access token is returned directly to the caller rather
 *     than re-read from the store (point 3).

 *     interceptors short-circuit on `_isRefresh = true` to avoid
 *     re-entering the auth logic for the refresh request itself.
 *   - The request is sent to the same path the original request was
 *     going to. The Go middleware short-circuits on the `cft` header
 *     and never reaches the route handler, so the path itself is
 *     irrelevant; using the original path keeps debugging easier.
 *   - A timeout is enforced so a wedged backend can't keep every
 *     queued request blocked indefinitely.
